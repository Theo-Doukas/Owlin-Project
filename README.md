Exercise 2 - Financial risk identification


In this exercise, you will be provided with a set of real news articles’ headers and abstracts. Your
task is to analyze the content of these articles in order to find the articles that have financial risk
themes (eg: bankruptcy and fines) for the companies specified below.
The challenge requires you to sift through the information, identify relevant details, and discard
any noise that does not contribute to the assessment of the financial risk of the companies. This
will test your ability to process complex data, extract meaningful insights, and deliver accurate
results.
While we recommend using Python for this exercise, you are free to use any method or platform
you prefer. We encourage you to go beyond the core requirements—think creatively and bring
other valuable insights to the table.
