8-4-2024,"Man Who Allegedly Decapitated Dad, Shared to YouTube Deemed Competent to Stand Trial","After having previously been determined to have schizophrenia by Dr. John Markey, who spent time with Mohn on four different occasions, the doctor changed his diagnosis to delusional disorder, based on new findings. But none of that kept Mohn from being declared competent to stand trial. On Thursday in Doylestown, Mohn was declared mentally fit to stand trial for the alleged murder and beheading of his father, followed by a video ""manifesto"" posted to YouTube that appeared to include his father's severed head. Judge Stephen Corr made his ruling after a five-hour process that involved multiple witnesses. During the proceeding, he also granted Mohn's wish to dismiss his public defender and have a different attorney appointed to handle his case. As reported by CNN, Mohn could be seen nodding and smiling as prosecution witness Dr. Kelly Chamberlain described him as intelligent, calm and socially appropriate. She said that it was Mohn who objected to his defense attorney's attempt to use mental health as a defense, arguing he was appropriately ""self-interested."" Markey continued to counter the prosecution's case that Mohn was of sound mind by saying with the defendant ""it's all delusional."" He cited several letters, in which Mohn reportedly claimed to be the messiah, a King David-like figure persecuted by the federal government. According to Markey, Mohn believed his own attoreny was a federal agent working against him. He further claimed that Mohn had written a letter to Russia's ambassador to the U.S. seeking to strike a deal for refuge in Russia, while also apologizing to President Vladimir Putin for claiming to be the czar of Russia. Chamberlain pushed back on this narrative, arguing that she doesn't believe Mohn meant to say he was the messiah, but rather that he believed ""Satanic"" cults in the U.S. think he's the messiah. ""I believe it could be construed as delusional,"" she conceded, but said that his letters were part of a recurring and common rhetoric. ""He feels people like him have been kind of screwed over."" As she spoke, Mohn nodded, per CNN. Mohn was first arrested in late January for the murder of his father. On February 2, the DA in Bucks County, PA released disturbing details about the crime. In a press conference, DA Jennifer Schorn revealed that police were dispatched to Michael Mohn's Middletown Township after his wife Denise came home to find her husband decapitated inside the bathroom. When police arrived, they found the decapitated body, before locating Michael's head wrapped in saran wrap and in a cooking pot in an adjacent room. Schorn revealed police received multiple phone calls about a YouTube video Justin posted in which he was seen holding up his father's head. The 14:32-long video was titled ""Mohn's Militia,"" with Schorn describing it as a ""call to arms for American patriots."" She said it appeared to be filmed in the same bedroom where bloody gloves were found -- and showed Justin ""holding a human head detached from the body which is wrapped in plastic,"" saying it belonged to his father, who was ""in hell for being a traitor to his country."" In the video, he went on to call himself ""the commander of America's national network of militia"" and advised his followers to torture and kill federal employees. According to Schorn, Justin was apprehended after authorities pinged his cell phone -- and located him at a National Guard training center at Fort Indiantown Gap. He had allegedly ""climbed a barbed wire fence, and entered the secured military installation,"" but was taken in without incident. The victim died from a gunshot wound to the head and was dismembered with both a knife and machete after his death. According to Schorn, the suspect purchased the gun used in the crime the day before -- and did so legally. ""There was nothing legally precluding him from buying that gun. In fact, our investigation has revealed he surrendered his medical marijuana card so as to be eligible to legally possess a gun,"" she claimed. ""Also shows you the clear state of mind that he was in having planned what he ultimately carried out."" She said he had no history of diagnosed mental health issues and had never been committed, either voluntarily or involuntarily. She went on to call it ""quite horrifying"" how many people viewed the YouTube video before it was taken down -- calling it ""incredibly concerning"" as well. She added that they were able to capture the footage, however, which was important to have from an evidentiary standpoint. Middletown Township Police Chief Joseph Bartorilla said his department, specifically, had three prior instances involving Mohn -- starting with one in 2011, when the suspect was 19 and had an argument with someone in his driveway. That didn't rise to anything criminal, said Bartorilla. The second instance was in 2019, when Mohn called police saying he received a threat from someone he was suing ... while the third came in 2023, when his employer in Philadelphia called police to express ""concern about Justin's behavior at work and wanted legal advice on how to go about terminating his employment."" Bartorilla said the officer referred the caller to seek out legal resources for their concerns, as well as to the Philadelphia Police Department . ""I think there was concern over what Justin was writing, some novels he was writing, but we did not have contact with him after that,"" he added. ""I don't think we needed to have contact with him after that."" Mohn has been charged with first-degree murder, abusing a corpse and possession of instruments of crime. He is being held without bail.",https://www.toofab.com/2024/08/04/man-allegedly-decapitated-dad-shared-youtube-deemed-competent-stand-trial/,en,toofab.com

8-2-2024,   Amazon quarterly profit doubles as cloud business grows,"Credits: Courtesy of Amazon Amazon reported Thursday its profit in the recently ended quarter doubled to 13.5 billion dollars with the help of renewed momentum of its AWS cloud computing business. The e-commerce giant's sales of 148 billion dollars fell just shy of lofty market expectations, however, and shares slid more than four percent to $176.50 in after-market trades. ""We're continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,"" said Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy. Revenue at the AWS cloud computing unit grew to 26.3 billion dollars compared with 22.1 billion dollars in the same period a year earlier, according to earnings figures. The 12.7 billion dollars taken in from ads on the platform was also shy of expectations, with the market predicting 13 billion dollars. Retail, ads and cloud computing are considered Amazon's financial pillars. ""While Amazon has multiple levers it can pull, the outlook is becoming tighter,"" said GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders. ""Amazon will remain very profitable but the pace at which it can add to the bottom line appears to be waning."" Amazon -- like other tech giants investing in AI -- is also spending more money, a factor investors are watching keenly. Microsoft saw its shares slip this week on earnings figures showing its crucial cloud computing unit did not grow as strongly as expected. Shares of Google parent Alphabet dropped on concerns that ad revenue was slowing while costs were on the rise after its earnings release. ""Meta stands out from other tech firms that have AI ambitions because it already brings in a massive amount of revenue from digital advertising,"" said Sonata Insights founder and chief analyst Debra Aho Williamson. ""Unlike Google, which is grappling with making changes that will impact its core ad business, most of Meta's AI investments are either aimed at making advertising on its properties work better, or at building new features that could eventually become revenue drivers."" New cloud boss The head of Amazon's AWS cloud computing business, Adam Selipsky, who was helping lead the company's expansion into AI, unexpectedly left the company in June. In a memo to staff, Selipsky said he was leaving with ""mixed emotions,"" but ""given the state of the business and the leadership team, now is an appropriate moment for me to make this transition."" Amazon sales and marketing executive Matt Garman took over as head of AWS. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a key subsidiary of the tech giant, capitalizing on the growing appetite among businesses for remote computer and artificial intelligence services. AWS had 31 percent of the cloud computing market at the end of 2023, according to Stocklytics. But rivals Microsoft and Google are gaining ground with their cloud businesses. The race has become particularly heated since the deployment of ChatGPT-style artificial intelligence that the cloud companies are offering to clients who want to buy into the AI revolution. But AWS is less known to the public and Amazon does not have flagship AI brands such as ChatGPT or Google's Gemini that are being deployed across those firms' lines of products.(AFP)",https://fashionunited.com/executive/management/amazon-quarterly-profit-doubles-as-cloud-business-grows/2024080261220,en,fashionunited.com

Experts and analysts say that the idiosyncrasies of the technology sector mean it could easily happen again. Quality vs speed CrowdStrike has given its version of events leading up to the July 19 crash. But for independent IT expert Fernando Maldonado, one of the causes of CrowdStrike's failure is in the way the cybersecurity industry competes with cybercriminals.

So, to close the window between when a threat is discovered and when you cover it, you have to pick up a certain speed,"" which can lead to a lack of attention to the quality of this update, he says.",https://www.csoonline.com/article/3480501/crowdstrike-failure-the-beginning-of-the-end-of-software-without-guarantees.html,en,csoonline.com

8-1-2024,Atos slides deeper into the red,"Atos, struggling to restructure its business operations, has presented its financials for the first half of 2024. The ailing French IT services provider recorded an operating loss of €1.7 billion (about $1.8 billion)in the first six months of the year, compared to a loss of €434 million a year earlier; Its net loss for the half-year was €1.91 billion, compared to €600 million a year prevously. Atos executives blamed weaker business as well as high depreciation and one-off impairment charges of almost €1.6 billion for the disappointing figures. The service provider's revenue between January and June of this year amounted to €4.96 billion, down 10% year on year. Atos preferred to focus on the 2.7% decline at constant scope and exchange rates. The Eviden division, in which Atos has bundled its most promising business areas, lost more than the legacy Tech Foundations side. Eviden's sales fell by 4.2 percent year-on-year from €2.49 billion (at constant scope and exchange rates) to €2.39 billion. Tech Foundations' revenue slipped by 1.4 percent from €2.61 billion to €2.58 billion. Originally, Atos had planned to split up much like IBM and Kyndryl did, selling Tech Foundations, but this plan was finally shattered at the beginning of 2024 and the service provider subsequently got more and more into financial difficulties. Protective shield proceedings as a lifeline Atos is currently fighting for its business future. It is currently seeking debtors' protection through the French legal system: That will be decided by the commercial court in mid-October. The service provider recently gained some breathing space with interim financing of €1.67 billion from banks and bondholders. Meanwhile, the debt burden that weighs on Atos has grown, from €2.32 billion in mid-2023 to €4.22 billion now. Atos Chairman and CEO Jean Pierre Mustier hopes for better times. Mustier only took over as CEO from Paul Saleh at the end of July; Saleh lasted just six months in the role. ""The opening of an accelerated safeguard proceedings by the Commercial Court is an important step in Atos' financial restructuring process. We now have an agreement with our financial creditors that provides ample liquidity to run the Company and establishes strong foundations for the company's future."" Will France buy Atos' BDS division? Mustier pointed out that Atos had achieved its forecasts regarding its business targets, ""despite soft market conditions in some of our key geographies."" Intensive negotiations are currently underway with the French state. The main focus is on the future of security-related areas of Atos, such as the Bull SA division and the Big Data & Security (BDS) business. Market observers speculate that in the past, concerns on the part of French politicians could also have been responsible for the failure of sales negotiations. Currently, the Atos management has received an offer of €700 million from the French state for parts of the BDS division. This is at the very lower end of the price range. A few months ago, Atos had estimated the value at €700 million to €1 billion. Together with conciliator Maître Hélène Bourbouloux, the Atos management is currently discussing the offer, the company said. However, Atos said that it could not give any assurance that these talks would be successful and that a conclusion would be reached",https://www.cio.com/article/3480402/atos-slides-deeper-into-the-red.html,en,cio.com

Recent security software CrowdStrike due to the EDR software update contract, triggered around 8.5 million Microsoft computers around the world, appearing blue current screen (BSOD) security incidents. At the beginning of the incident, due to the uncertainty of what caused the blue instant screen, Microsoft first appeared to apologize, but also to trace should be related to CrowdStrike's EDR update package. In the research company IDC for the market share of EDR products, CrowdStrike is more frequently ranked first, plus the top five hundred companies in the United States, which also made CrowdStrike the world's headline news after the appearance of the blue localization screen due to the update package. The real reason, or it is necessary to wait for CrowdStrike to complete the investigation and publication, before there may be further understanding, however, according to the speculation of anonymous security experts who have studied the security of the Microsoft operating system, CrowdStrike is due to the update error, because it has a bad design characteristics package, leading to the driver logic of the operating system core problems (Parser resolution logic is bad), so will misuse the indicator of the non-existence of memory null-pointer to read the content, causing the BSOD blue current screen.",https://www.ithome.com.tw/news/164259,zh,ithome.com.tw

8-1-2024,Hitachi High-Tech Acquires Majority Interest in Nabsys,"Tokyo and Providence, RI, Aug 1, 2024 - (JCN Newswire) - Hitachi High-Tech Corporation (Hitachi High- Tech) and Nabsys 2.0 LLC (Nabsys) announced today that Hitachi High-Tech has acquired a majority interest in Nabsys, a developer and manufacturer of instrumentation and consumables for the analysis of genomic structural variation. This transaction will make Nabsys a consolidated subsidiary of Hitachi High-Tech Group.OhmX (The monitor shows an analysis image by Human Chromosome Explorer) Hitachi High-Tech first invested in and formed an alliance with Nabsys in 2019 to fully realize the promise of genomics and improve human health through a scalable platform capable of interrogating structural variants (SVs). Through thesupport of Hitachi High-Tech, Nabsys has entered into a commercialization phase with the ""OhmX Analyzer (OhmX)""; an electronic genome mapping platform for high-resolution SV analysis. By making Nabsys a consolidated subsidiary, Hitachi High-Tech group aims to accelerate the adoption of OhmX, and envisions the technology will substantively evolve to address critical diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic research gaps while promising to strengthening itsmolecular diagnostics business as part of its mission to create a society without fear of cancer and rare disease.BackgroundSVs are the dominant form of genomic variation and implicated in a wide array of disease states. Electronic genome mapping provides information that traditional cytogenetics and short-read sequencing do not fully cover and thuspotentially improves the identification of SVs implicated in rare diseases. Further, identifying SVs might propel the identification of some oncogenic drivers, which are critical mutations promoting cancer initiation and progression.Hitachi High-Tech and Nabsys have collaborated on SV analysis since 2019, with Nabsys focused on instrumentation and consumables and Hitachi High-Tech developing a cloud- based analytic suite called Human Chromosome Explorer (HCE). This has culminated in the OhmX system. OhmX uses a high signal-to-noise electronic detection methodology in which solid-state nanochannels measure the shapes of long DNA molecules traveling at high speeds. OhmX 's use of electronic detection keeps the instrument footprint small (about the size of a desktop computer) and the cost of SV analysis low. When combined with HCE, the system captures and visualizes SVs at small enoughlength scales to be complimentary to short-read sequencing, with reads long enough to capture large structural rearrangements.Future DevelopmentsIn addition to strengthening Nabsys' development and production, Hitachi High-Tech will combine the platform with itsdata analysis technology to scale and expand electronic genome mapping globally.Hitachi High-Tech's healthcare business states its purpose as ""Innovating Healthcare, Embracing the Future"", and by integrating diagnosis, therapy and the digital, we are working to create healthcare innovations that support optimization of healthcare across the board, including high-quality, highly functional in-vitro diagnosis and minimally invasive radiation therapy. We will continue to contribute to improving quality of life for people around the world by supporting the provision of personalized medical care for each and every patient.Messages from ManagementHitachi High-Tech Vice President and Executive Officer, and General Manager, Healthcare Business Group Yoshimitsu TakagiHitachi High-Tech is currently working to strengthen its molecular diagnostics business, which is centered around genetic testing. By combining Nabsys' genome mapping technology with Hitachi High-Tech's HCE, we aim to build unique solutions that contribute to the research of cancer and undiagnosed diseases, and aid in the development of diagnostic methods.Furthermore, by making Nabsys a consolidated subsidiary, Hitachi High-Tech Group will be able to make maximum use of the human resources, knowledge, and technology of both companies, and will expand its genome mapping-related business globally.Nabsys CEO Barrett BreadyHitachi High-Tech has had a long and successful history in genomics. Their vision of ameliorating disease and suffering through technology aligns closely with Nabsys' mission.We're thrilled that the electronic genome mapping platform that the Nabsys team has developed will be able to contribute to achieving that vision.About Hitachi High-TechHitachi High-Tech, headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, is engaged in activities in a broad range of fields, including manufacture and sales of clinical analyzers, biotechnology products, radiation therapy systems, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, analytical instruments, and analysis equipment. Also, we provide high value-added solutions in industrial fields such as mobility, connected, environment and energy, etc. Through business based on our core Observation, Measurement and Analysis technologies, we will contribute to the realization of a sustainable society by solving social issues.The company's consolidated revenues for FY2023 were approx. JPY 670.4 billion.For further information, visit https://www.hitachi-hightech.com/global/en/About NabsysBased in Providence, Rhode Island, Nabsys employs a multidisciplinary team of specialists, including scientists,engineers and other professionals devoted to advancing genomic analysis.

The consortium's bid underscores the growing interest of international investors in India's vibrant consumer goods sector.

The outcome of this bid could set a precedent for future investments in the Indian consumer goods sector, showcasing the growing confidence of global investors in the country's economic prospects. Blackstone, a leading global investment firm, and ADIA, one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds, bring substantial financial expertise and strategic vision to the table. Their joint bid signifies a serious commitment to supporting Haldiram's growth trajectory and expanding its global reach. The involvement of these heavyweight investors could also drive further investment interest in India's food sector, fostering a more dynamic and competitive market environment.

The outcome will likely influence future investment strategies in similar high-growth sectors within the country. The strategic partnership between Blackstone and ADIA is poised to play a crucial role in shaping the future of Haldiram's and the broader Indian consumer goods market. The collaboration between Blackstone and ADIA in bidding for a significant stake in Haldiram's underscores the growing international interest in India's expanding consumer sector.

7-30-2024,Nasdaq falls again while Dow advances,"The tech-rich Nasdaq tumbled again while the Dow forged higher on Tuesday as investors continued to steer funds away from artificial intelligence equities toward other sectors. The ongoing so-called ""rotation"" from tech giants to smaller and medium-sized company comes as some of the biggest tech companies are set to report quarterly results in the coming days. But Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, noted that this buying trend may be almost over now that Microsoft, Nvidia and others have fallen significantly from their peaks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 percent to 40,743. The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 0.5 percent to 5,436, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.3 percent to 17,147. Microsoft reported after the market closed on Tuesday, while Apple, Amazon and Facebook parent Meta will report over the next two days. ""This rotation likely stops when we get the majority of these mega caps to report,"" Hogan said. Among individual companies, Procter & Gamble dropped 4.9 percent as it reported a seven percent fall in quarterly profits on flat sales. Crowdstrike also plunged nearly 10 percent following reports Delta hired attorney David Boies to seek damages following an IT outage that threw the airline's operations into turmoil for several days. Besides the deluge of corporate earnings, this week's calendar includes Wednesday's Fed decision, as well as monthly US employment data on Friday.

Krafton Inc, the South Korean games company best known for its work on PUBG and The Callisto Protocol - has acquired Tango Gameworks and the award winning Hi-Fi Rush IP from Microsoft ahead of the studio's closure. Tango Gameworks, which created the excellent Hi-Fi Rush in January 2023, will be leaping from one company to the other, taking all the staff who would otherwise have been laid off with it. In a PR statement, Krafton describes this as its ""first significant investment in the Japanese video game market"", though other video game IP from Tango including Ghostwire Tokyo and The Evil Within remain in Microsoft's hands. This is quite a sudden and exciting bit of news in what has otherwise been a depressing spree of video game layoffs and studio closure stories. The announcement that Microsoft was closing Tango Gameworks, alongside Arkane Austin and Alpha Dog Games, hit the industry like a frieght train. While all three studios had obvious merit Tango had only recently won awards for Hi-Fi Rush - a relatively cheap game with a brand-new IP, something Microsoft seemingly would want in this current climate.

8-12-2024,Cisco prepares for another round of layoffs,""" Cisco Systems is reportedly planning a second wave of job cuts this year, potentially affecting thousands of employees, as the company shifts its focus to higher-growth areas like cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. This follows the layoff of approximately 4,000 employees in February. Sources indicate that the number of layoffs could match or exceed the previous round, with an announcement expected to coincide with Cisco's fourth-quarter results on Wednesday. Cisco, which employed around 84,900 people as of July 2023, has been grappling with reduced demand and supply-chain challenges in its core business of routers and switches. In response, the company has sought to diversify, completing a $28 billion acquisition of cybersecurity firm Splunk in March to strengthen its subscription services. Cisco recently launched a $1 billion global investment fund to accelerate the development of secure and reliable AI solutions. As part of this initiative, it has made strategic investments in startups like Cohere, Mistral AI, and Scale AI, reinforcing its strategy to connect and protect the AI era. Last week, tech giant Dell announced the elimination of approximately 12,500 jobs, marking the second round of layoffs in under 15 months as the company accelerates its shift toward AI. The internal memo revealed plans to centralise sales teams and establish a dedicated unit for AI products and services, raising concerns about job security in the tech sector. Earlier this month, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger also issued a memo on August 1, 2024, outlining a cost-cutting initiative following the company's second-quarter 2024 earnings release. These layoffs reflect a broader trend in the tech industry, where significant workforce reductions are being made to support large investments in AI. These layoffs underscore a broader trend in the tech industry, where companies are cutting costs to manage large-scale investments in AI.",https://www.peoplematters.in/news/technology/cisco-prepares-for-another-round-of-layoffs-42341,en,peoplematters.in

8-10-2024,Former Twitter chairman is suing X for $20 million over pay he says was 'wrongfully withheld',"Omid Kordestani, who was Twitter's executive chairman from 2015 to 2020 and served on the board until Elon Musk acquired it in 2022, is suing X over $20 million worth of shares he says the company is refusing to pay. Kordestani filed the lawsuit on Friday with a California superior court. Per the lawsuit, Kordestani left a high paying job at Google to join Twitter, which offered him a ""significantly lower"" salary of just $50,000 but sweetened the deal with stock options, performance-based restricted stock units and restricted stock units. These — amounting to $20,112,000 — were supposed to have been paid out when Musk acquired Twitter and replaced the board, but X has failed to do so, according to the lawsuit. ""X Corp. seeks to reap the benefits of Mr. Kordestani's seven years of service to Twitter without paying him for it, despite clear contractual language requiring X Corp. to do so,"" it says. Multiple lawsuits have been filed in the wake of Musk's Twitter acquisition from employees alleging they were not paid properly after they were laid off or fired. Former Twitter executives sued Musk and X earlier this year, claiming they were fired ""without reason"" and are owed millions of dollars in unpaid severance. The latest lawsuit says that ""Mr. Kordestani is one of many former Twitter employees whose compensation has been wrongfully withheld by X Corp. following Elon Musk's purchase of the Company in October 2022.""This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/former-twitter-chairman-is-suing-x-for-20-million-over-pay-he-says-was-wrongfully-withheld-155407305.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/former-twitter-chairman-is-suing-x-for-20-million-over-pay-he-says-was-wrongfully-withheld-155407305.html?src=rss,en,engadget.com

8-10-2024,Does Apple Intelligence Prioritize Phishing Emails? Social Media Users Say Yes,"Users on social media platforms like Reddit and Panic/Mastodon are raising concerns that Apple's AI platform, Apple Intelligence, is prioritizing phishing emails.One Reddit user, icedout223, shared that Apple Intelligence added a phishing email to their priority list. The email, generated by a leading American telecom firm, was marked as urgent, and users are unhappy with Apple Intelligence's decision.Another Reddit user compared Apple Intelligence to a ""boomer dad,"" criticizing its failure to recognize and properly handle phishing attempts. The email previews showed messages threatening account suspensions unless users updated their payment information.Similarly, on Panic/Mastodon, a user reported a similar experience, expressing alarm that phishing attempts were being flagged as priority. While verifying email authenticity is increasingly challenging, users feel companies like Apple should be doing more.Experts suggest that Apple's algorithm is designed to analyze the subject line and body content, which might explain why phishing emails pass through as priority. The tone, urgency, and structure of these emails are likely factors in Apple's decision-making process. However, the system needs to be revamped to better detect phishing attempts and prevent such emails from being prioritized.In response to phishing emails, users should never click on suspicious links and report such incidents to their service providers. Improved training models and AI algorithms are essential to prevent these issues from occurring in the future.Read next: Researcher Warns of Security Threats in Microsoft's Copilot, Exposing AI to Data Breaches and Phishing",https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2024/08/does-apple-intelligence-prioritize.html,en,digitalinformationworld.com

8-9-2024,"Cisco to follow Dell with layoff announcement, likely next week: Report","A new round of layoff announcements at Dell and Cisco are a result of both companies currently losing core market share to new industry competitors: Arista Networks for Cisco, in their core networking business, and low-cost PC manufacturers like Acer for Dell, an analyst said Friday. Scott Bickley, advisory practice lead at Info-Tech Research Group, was responding to major announcements from the two organizations regarding layoffs. The latest occurred Friday, when Reuters reported that sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly, had revealed that job cuts will likely be announced by Cisco ""as early as Wednesday along with its fourth-quarter results."" According to Reuters, the number of people affected could be similar to or slightly higher than the 4,000 employees Cisco laid off in February. The Reuters report stated that the company has been ""grappling with sluggish demand and supply-chain constraints in its mainstay business. That has pushed the company to diversify, with moves such as its $28 billion buyout of cybersecurity firm Splunk."" Meanwhile, on Tuesday, a Bloomberg report indicated that Dell is reportedly laying off thousands of staffers from its sales team, ""part of the hardware vendor's reorganization efforts targeted at increasing its revenues from AI-related sales by putting in a new sales unit focused on AI products."" Info-Tech's Bickley stated in an email that ""combined with tepid customer demand, [both organizations] need to streamline operations to maintain profit margins. They are hiding behind the illusion of investing in AI and cybersecurity, which is partially true but likely not the primary reason for the cuts. Cisco is a second-rate player in the cybersecurity space at best, and they already have an AI plan in place to support hyperscaler infrastructure, so why the cuts now?"" Cisco's last earnings report in April, he said, ""showed a major decline in revenues and net income, which is a disturbing trend for them of late. I view these cuts as an ill-fated attempt to cut their way to profitability. Cisco also reports earnings on August 14. They may be trying to get ahead of another poor-performing quarter and throwing all the bad news into the 'kitchen sink.'"" Bickley added, ""The recent Splunk acquisition likely plays a part in the RIF [reduction in force] as they seek to integrate this company. There is likely an overlap in management talent and sales teams which would need to be rationalized. There will also be a material expense in integrating Splunk into the Cisco core products, which needs to be funded.""",https://www.networkworld.com/article/3485242/cisco-to-follow-dell-with-layoff-announcement-likely-next-week-report.html,en,networkworld.com

8-9-2024,Cisco Prepares Second Round Of Layoffs Amid Increasing AI Skepticism; Report,"Cisco Prepares Second Round Of Layoffs Amid Increasing AI Skepticism; Report The potential of generative AI to transform companies, industries, and societies has been widely touted around the clock by Wall Street analysts and MSM, resulting in what could be a trillion-dollar spending spree in capital investments by companies in the coming years. These investments will cover data centers, chips, AI infrastructure, and the power grid. However, given this context, as AI infrastructure is being built, one of America's largest networking equipment firms building AI infrastructure could be on the verge of thousands of layoffs. This news doesn't bode well for the AI bubble. Reuters, citing 'people familiar with the matter,' reports that Cisco plans to cut thousands of jobs in a second round of layoffs. These cuts could be similar in scale to the 4,000 layoffs in February and may be announced as early as next Wednesday. Cisco is the largest maker of routers and switches that direct internet traffic. The company announced plans to deliver AI infrastructure solutions to data centers with Nvidia earlier this year. Sluggish demand and supply-chain constraints could indicate an emerging slowdown in building an AI compute-based environment. The latest data from Bloomberg shows Cisco employed around 84,900 people as of July 2023. That number does not include the February layoffs that Reuters first reported. At the time, we penned this note: ""Cisco To Fire ""Thousands, Adding To Firehose Of Tech Layoffs Since Beginning Of 2024."" The bear market in Nvidia has some questioning valuations and whether the AI bubble has reached a near-term peak. In early July, Goldman's Allison Nathan said despite the rising spending trends in ""data centers, chips, other AI infrastructure, and the power grid"" by companies, this has yet to translate into ""efficiency gains among developers."" The developing theme is that investor enthusiasm about the potential financial returns from AI has shifted to skepticism. In short, the trillions in market cap gained by the Big 7 - the biggest bubble in history - has yet to produce adequate returns. Potential Cisco layoffs, which would be the second round of the year, are an ominous sign for the stability of the AI bubble.

8-9-2024,"Delta puts numbers on CrowdStrike outage, sets up interesting discovery period","By Larry Dignan Delta put some figures on its plans to recover at least $500 million in damages from CrowdStrike and Microsoft. In an SEC filing, Delta broke down the outage impact this way: $380 million direct revenue impact due to refunds and customer compensation with SkyMiles or cash. $170 million in non-fuel expenses due to operational recovery, which includes customer expense reimbursement and crew costs. $50 million in gains from lower fuel expenses due to 7,000 flight cancellations. Add it up and you get to Delta's $500 million figure. CrowdStrike and Microsoft have volleyed letters with Delta and the core points against Delta were: Both vendors offered to help Delta, but didn't get responses. Delta's creaky infrastructure and IT practices shouldn't be put on vendors. Delta has to explain why it couldn't recover when competitors restored operations faster. What's next? More volleying between a customer and two vendors and a handful of lawsuits. The discovery process on Delta's technical architecture is going to be fascinating to watch and fodder for IT management case studies in the future.

Five9 had the easiest dialer integration to Salesforce, which it made it the de facto dialer for enterprise call centers–at least so long as Salesforce feared deploying its own autodialer to avoid TCPA exposure. But Five9 happily stepped into the fray and gobbled up market share, even if its solutions were never terribly pleasing and their customer service left many aghast (or so the Czar has been told in the past.) Other dialer platforms have carved out their own market share, positioning themselves around the TCPA. LiveVox, Genesys, Noble, Convoso and more recently Customer Dynamics are all players.

""We're introducing updated terms that will apply this fall for developers with apps in the European Union storefronts of the App…",https://biztoc.com/x/78e32f756c82eb84?ref=ff,en,biztoc.com
8-8-2024,Apple Revises EU App Store After 'Anti-Steering' Probe,"Apple Revises EU App Store After 'Anti-Steering' Probe Following the European Commission's announcement in June that Apple violated the Digital Markets Act with its App Store anti-steering rules, the world's most valuable company has revised its policy. Apple introduced a new fee structure for the EU App Store's ""link-outs."" This allows app developers to include a link that redirects customers to a web page where they can complete a transaction. For context, the tech blog 9to5Mac explained: Previously, Apple enforced strict rules that dictated how apps in the EU were allowed to link out. This included requirements that the link be statically defined, and go directly to their own website, without any parameters to identify the logged-in user in the URL. This limited the ability of apps to directly send users to a webpage where they could pay to add upgrades to their account. As for the new fee structure, 9to5Mac explained further: Under today's changes, all of those restrictions are now gone. Apps can offer actionable links with as many dynamic URLs as they please. These links can take the user to anywhere, including as a way to promote other sales channels like alternative app marketplaces. The URLs can include parameters, as long as those parameters are not used for advertising or user profiling. These links also used to be required to kick the user outside of the current app and into their web browser, like Safari. However, Apple is now allowing these links to be opened inside the originating app, as a modal web view. Apple is also updating the user disclosure sheet with a new design that is more friendly, and includes an interface toggle for users to opt-out of seeing disclosure sheets when tapping external purchase links in the future. For now, developers have to continue to implement this sheet manually, but Apple announced it will be automatically managed and presented by the ExternalPurchaseCustomLink API in a future iOS update. Moreover, developers can now take advantage of these capabilities in the EU, without agreeing to alternative business terms. That means they can remain in the App Store and avoid paying the Core Technology Fee on installs. However, there is a new substitute fee structure instead … Apple will also introduce two new fee structures for apps that link out of its App Store, including an initial 5% acquisition fee for new users and a 10% store services fee for any sales made by app users on any platform within the 12 months of the app installation. 9to5Mac pointed out: Apple says the new structure results in lower fees for developers in both the alternative and existing terms for linking out, especially for existing users. This is because previously Apple charged upwards of 17% and the Core Technology Fee, for the privilege of linking out to an alternative payment method. In June, the commission officially investigated Apple App Store's anti-steering rules outside the platform. Apple is changing its App Store policies to comply with the Digital Markets Act and avoid fines by the EU.

8-8-2024,Investors Pull $2.2 Billion From ARKK In 2024 As Cathie Wood Underperforms Nasdaq By -30% YTD,"Investors Pull $2.2 Billion From ARKK In 2024 As Cathie Wood Underperforms Nasdaq By -30% YTD Cathie Wood appears to be doing what she does best: buying the 'dip' in an overvalued market, socking away aggressively valued companies that have a knack for plunging far further than market indexes on selloffs. The ARKK fund manager is buying shares of Amazon.com Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Roku Inc. amidst the recent market volatility, Bloomberg reported this week. But ARKK closed at its lowest levels since November and at YTD lows on Wednesday, amidst the volatility, while the NASDAQ was still in green territory for the year, the report says. Wood's flagship 'innovation' fund is down about -24% YTD versus the QQQ, which is up about 6.8%, as of Thursday mid-morning. That's a pretty noticeable underperformance for just 8 months into the year. And investors seem to be taking note: about 75% of ARKK's value from 2021 has been wiped away and, as of Tuesday, investors have withdrawn $2.2 billion from ARKK in 2024, setting it up for its worst year of outflows since its 2014 inception, Bloomberg writes. Overall, Cathie Wood's seven active ETFs have experienced $11.5 billion in outflows since early 2021, according to Strategas data. Todd Sohn, an ETF strategist at Strategas said: ""The past few years, really, have been a challenge. Ark has a history of high-conviction, concentrated investing via their ETFs — there's a tendency for the team to use sharp market selloffs as an opportunity to add long exposure to their strongest ideas."" The only problem? Many would argue a quick snapback from all time highs may not be a ""sharp market selloff"". In late May, Zero Hedge contributor Quoth the Raven was quick to criticize Cathie Wood blaming a 'great depression' for her poor performance - all before the recent volatility even took place. Post-Tesla's 2020 surge, QTR argued that Wood's fund has been dead money: ""Since then, Wood's ARKK flagship fund has been dead money when compared to its NASDAQ benchmark. One by one, investors have watched other investments that Wood has made alongside Tesla get decimated. For example, the ""visionary"" tech investor made a strategic decision to hold off and miss the surge in Nvidia — literally the hottest name in tech the last 2 years — while riding names like Invitae and Ginkgo Bioworks into bankruptcy and the toilet, respectively."" ""To compound her dreadful numbers, Wood has offered up bizarre, hallucinogenic price targets, unbridled optimism about her own performance going forward that, in my opinion, has been very misleading, and bursts of macro-sounding non-sequiturs as excuses,"" he wrote. In May with the market sitting at all-time highs—Wood claimed markets were experiencing ""a search for cash and safety."" In fact, she said the search for safety at the beginning of the summer had been ""as intense as that during the Great Depression in the early 1930s."" Back in February, Morningstar listed her as one of the top 15 funds that have destroyed the most wealth over the past decade and said the ARK family of funds had wiped out $14.3 billion in shareholder value. ARK, home of the flagship ARK Innovation ETF ARKK, tops the list for value destruction. After garnering huge asset flows in 2020 and 2021 (totaling an estimated $29.2 billion), its funds were decimated in the 2022 bear market, with losses ranging from 34.1% to 67.5% for the year. Many of its funds enjoyed a strong rebound in 2023, but that wasn't enough to offset their previous losses. As a result, the ARK family wiped out an estimated $14.3 billion in shareholder value over the 10-year period—more than twice as much as the second-worst fund family on the list. ARK Innovation alone accounts for about $7.1 billion of value destruction over the trailing 10-year period. Wood was top of the heap in wealth-destroying: Tyler Durden Thu, 08/08/2024 - 14:00",https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/investors-pull-22-billion-arkk-2024-cathie-wood-underperforms-nasdaq-30-ytd,en,zerohedge.com

The company reported higher revenues year over year, backed by solid demand trends in both segments. In addition, incremental revenues from Inmarsat contributed significantly to the top-line growth.

8-7-2024,"Meet Jennifer Morgan, the new CEO of HR tech powerhouse UKG","Jennifer Morgan, the former co-CEO of SAP and more recently global operations head of Blackstone, is taking the reins as CEO of HR tech giant UKG. She succeeds Chris Todd, a UKG veteran and protegé of Executive Chairman Aron Ain. Morgan is no stranger to the enterprise software industry, and she brings more than just corporate management and technical expertise to the HCM specialist. With UKG touting itself as a people-focused organisation, Morgan's greatest asset will be her own style of people leadership and strong industry insights. After all, the HR tech sector – out of all the segments of the larger enterprise tech industry – is the one most attuned to serving people and developing unique solutions around their needs. Ain is confident Morgan's unique blend of experience and skills will propel UKG as it ""enters the next level of rapid growth and scale"". Improving employee experiences at scale Growth-oriented is only one of the many attributes of Morgan as a corporate leader. In her 16 years at SAP and, subsequently, her three years as portfolio operations head at Blackstone, she was at the frontlines of developing and executing on the companies' respective growth strategies. Fortune, Forbes and Great Place to Work have all lauded Morgan for her exceptional leadership. At Blackstone, for example, she worked closely with the CEOs and leadership teams of portfolio companies in their growth acceleration and value creation process. As Morgan sits at the helm as CEO of UKG, it's worth noting her former organisation Blackstone is also the largest minority shareholder of UKG. And, after having been part of UKG's Board of Directors since 2021, she would already be acquainted with the lay of the land at the HR tech company. It's now a matter of driving the growth agenda as the CEO. Morgan sees UKG as a category creator ""redefining what's possible for improving employee experiences at scale"". With her insights into the company's culture and operations, she is well positioned to enhance UKG's suite of tech solutions and align them with its corporate vision – that of turning every company into a ""great place to work,"" as the company proudly declares. ""I have long admired the company's culture-first solutions, world-class team and conviction in people as the true drivers of companies' success,"" Morgan reflected. ""I see tremendous opportunity for UKG to continue to reshape how companies achieve their talent and culture objectives through HR, talent, payroll, and workforce management solutions that exceed customers' current and future technology needs."" One of the 'most powerful' women in business and tech Time and again, Morgan has been hailed as one of the most powerful women in business and technology. Her appointment at UKG is a breath of fresh air for the HR tech sector – where meaningful innovation comes from the diversity of ideas. Morgan's commitment to raising a diverse workforce, however, extends outside the corporate sphere. She is a volunteer board member at the education-focused nonprofit NAF, which partners with business leaders to give the youth early exposure to the professional world. The aim is to ""prepare students of all backgrounds and capabilities for future success"". News of Morgan taking the helm at UKG was welcomed across the social web. As Madeline Laurano, founder of Aptitude Research, pointed out in her LinkedIn post: ""Women make up nearly half of the global workforce, yet they are significantly underrepresented in executive positions in HR tech."" Morgan's appointment is thus a ""testament to her exceptional skills and highlights the need for more women in leadership roles,"" Laurano said. For Morgan, she is more than ready to start ""accelerating the company's momentum"" of growth and innovation.",https://www.peoplemattersglobal.com/article/hr-technology/meet-jennifer-morgan-the-new-ceo-of-hr-tech-powerhouse-ukg-42320,en,peoplemattersglobal.com

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240806885236/en/ Figure 1: HPI & HPI Forecast % Change YoY (Graphic: Business Wire) U.S. year-over-year home price gains inched down, reaching 4.7% in June, falling further from the previous month's 4.9% in what will likely be a continual slide throughout the next year. Although June marked the 149th consecutive month of annual growth, the rate of growth is expected to decrease by more than half of its current rate, with prices expected to grow by only 2.3% on a year-over-year basis next summer. Month over month, home prices rose just 0.3% from May to June. The CoreLogic HPI Forecast indicates that prices will repeat that pattern, rising by 0.3% again from June 2024 to July 2024. In the years prior to pandemic, monthly gains from May to July generally saw stronger increases. The cooling of monthly gains during the spring home-buying season reflects the impact of high mortgage rates on home buyers' budgets and constraint on affordability. While no states posted annual home price declines in June, only one – South Dakota – posted double-digit growth, coming in at 10%. Behind South Dakota, the other states with the highest increases year over year were New Jersey (9.3%), Rhode Island (9.2%), Connecticut (8.5%), and New Hampshire (8.2%). Home prices in the 10 select large U.S. metros from June 2023 to June 2024 revealed that Miami posted the highest gain at 10% year over year. San Diego and Las Vegas tied for second at 7.5%, with Chicago coming in third at 7.2%. The continued decline in the pace of appreciation can be linked to elevated mortgage rates. Although the Federal Reserve Board is anticipated to cut rates in September, high interest rates continue to Full story available on Benzinga.com",https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/24/08/b40185586/corelogic-annual-us-home-price-growth-below-5-for-second-consecutive-month-as-june-home-prices-coo,en,benzinga.com

A U.S. federal judge has ruled that Google has illegally monopolized the search market by means of exclusive deals. The deal between Google and Apple is worth $20 billion a year. Why it is important. The agreement with Apple has been key to keeping Google’s dominance in searches, especially those made from the mobile. Its breakdown can redefine the landscape of the technology industry. What’s at stake: Google may lose preferential access to more than 1 billion iOS devices. Apple would lose a huge source of revenue, around 20% of its annual profit. It would open the door to new competitors in mobile searches. At the height of the generative IA. In Xataka SearchGPT poses the biggest threat in history for Google.

8-5-2024,HOT TAKE: Federal Court Rules Google Guilty; Maintained Monopoly in Ad Market,"By Liz Miller You don't have to read far into the filed documentation in the case of the United States of America v Google LLC. You get the big picture by page 4: Google is a monopolist. The History: In 2020, two separate lawsuits had been filed against Google, specifically one by the US Department of Justice and another by the State of Colorado. But that's not to say that every antitrust watchdog, every state's Attorney General and a raft of legislators and regulators were not already deep into proposed complaints and actions against the search and advertising giant. The lawsuits alleged that Google had violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act that makes it unlawful for any person to ""monopolize, attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States or with foreign nations…"" The section continues to define Monopolization requirements specifically as ""(1) monopoly power and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen or historic incident."" While discovery in the case began in late 2020, the bench trial itself did not kick off until September 2023 with closing arguments in May 2024. Throughout the plaintiffs alleged that Google held and illegally maintained a monopoly in three markets (General search services, search advertising, and general search text advertising) by entering into exclusive agreements to secure default distribution on desktop and mobile devices. The Ruling: Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google was a monopolist, but more specifically, Google acted as one to maintain this monopoly in two product markets, general search services and general text advertising, and entered into distribution agreements that are exclusive and have anticompetitive effects in these markets. The court also found that Google exercised its monopoly power by ""charging supracompetitive prices for general search text ads"" allowing ""Google to earn monopoly profits."" While portions of the full ruling do come down in favor of Google, excluding search advertising as a relevant product market and noting that Google was not required to work with or create deals with specific competitors or vendors in markets, the words are in literal black and white that Google is a monopoly with general search and text ads, resulting in a marketplace where Google has created and maintains its status as the only viable game in town despite the supposed availability of competitors. Analysis: For those who have been playing along with the bench trial and the release of evidence packages, this has all felt more like the boring draft of a Succession script than what is typically a rather boring straight forward case of antitrust arguments and evidentiary exchanges. From text exchanges about toggling speeds and results to convince market watchers new programs were designed to ""help the little guys"" while not making any substantive changes to the results or the ability for the ""little guys"" to beat out large advertisers in text ad auctions to the public airing of grievances between giants like Apple and Microsoft, this case has been bingeworthy and cringeworthy all at the same time. It is of note that Google has consistently increased prices of their solutions, especially the text-based advertising units, while conversion rates have continued to decrease. In a 2024 report from LocalIQ's investigation into search advertising benchmarks, while average conversion rates had dipped from 7.85% in 2022 to 7.04% in 2023, cost per lead (CPL) had increased by about 25%, click thru rate (CTR) had increased by about 5% and cost per click (CPC) had increase by 10% across all industries. In their report findings, the question was asked as to what Google could possibly be ""tuning"" to ""keep finding ways to justify higher prices despite not delivering equally greater returns."" While guilty headline of this case is a whopper, the reality here is that this trial was about liability, not about consequence or remedies. That phase of proceedings could bring anything from slaps on wrists and demands to stop doing naughty things to requirements to break-up the search business entirely. But it will certainly not bring the end to Google. The bigger news here is that this is just ONE case…and an early one that will likely serve as precedent for multiple antitrust cases the DOJ has lined up against Google and many others. Next up for Google is the massive advertising technology case that is set to kick off in September, 2024, United States of America v Google, LLC, in which the DOJ alleges Google monopolized multiple digital advertising technology products via serial acquisitions and anticompetitive auction manipulation to subvert competition. Amazon, Apple and Meta are all facing their own lawsuits from the government as wel, making this ruling an important guidepost for how these cases may be defined and adjudicated in the future. But What About AI? The crux of Googles defense was that competitors in each market has had the opportunity to compete and innovate. AI and especially the power of generative AI holds and its possible shakeup in the world of search was brought up several times in evidence and at trial. However, the court and the experts brought forward by the government said that while AI has made leaps and bounds, the standard bearing technology and processes deployed in search specifically have not made any meaningful impact or improvement in results. ""Despite these recent advances, AI has not supplanted the traditional ingredients that define general search…And it is not likely to do so anytime soon. Importantly, generative AI has not (or at least, not yet) eliminated or materially reduced the need for user data to deliver quality search results."" In other words, yes, AI and generative AI is a massive search opportunity...but as of the time of this ruling that oppportunity is more of an experiement wrapped in a wish than anything that could have subtantively aided the competition to make any gains against Google. Does This Matter? As for immediate backlash or impact on Marketers, this is a wait and see moment. The ruling has a long way to go before it actually DOES anything to Google, its business or how advertisers buy and do business with Google let alone its competitors. The biggest impact the case may have is in how an Act passed in 1890 is applied to how antitrust and market monopolization is addressed a distinctly twenty-first century digital world. Google for its part has already shared its intention to appeal the decision, stating that they should not be penalized for making the best search engine available. So now, we hold on until the remedy phase of the proceedings…and of course all the additional legislation that could not just change the digital advertising and marketing landscape forever. Keep an eye open for how acquisition rumors spread as these cases progress...especially those rumors where both supply and demand sides of markets become intertwined (yeah...looking right at you Hubspot acquisition rumors) and how these upcoming cases could bring the lengthy dance with cookies is entered into evidence. All of these moves could also apply new and interesting pressure to the non-advertising revenue drivers of business at Google to start to answer the hypothetical question of what comes next after a breakup? Where will the next massive wave of revenue come from? Image Credit: Image has been AI generated using Adobe Firefly Image 3 model.",http://constellationr.com/node/36158,en,constellationr.com
